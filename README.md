# Retention

Code for project evaluating the effect of teacher prepration mode on teacher employment and retention. We compare teachers who were certified through alternative versus traditional programs. Addtionally, we compare teachers certified through UT Austin to those certified through other Texas based systems like Texas Tech, Texas State, University of Houston. We are planning to run propensity score analysis to create balanced comparison groups and then run weighted least squares estimation and survival analysis to estimate the effect of preparation mode on the outcomes over time. 


# Data Sources

We use statewide longitudinal data collected by the Texas Education Agency (TEA), State Board for Educator Certification (SBEC), and the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board (THECB). We access the data through the Education Research Center (ERC) at The University of Texas at Austin. The data include teacher demographics, education history, certification route, certification program, certification scores, and employment history.
